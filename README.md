##Supermarket billing counter

It is a simple challenge from ezsnippet to create a react app which has following 
1.  5 Billing Counters
2.  Each Counter have few customers and each customer have some items in thier basket
3.  It takes 1sec to scan each item from the basket
4.  Next Customer should join the queue which has lease items remained

Didn't worked on UI it was just a fun problem to solve.
